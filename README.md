# Tictactoe

Very simple ugly tictacto but with a little twist :

A implementation of the minimax algorithm

The Minimax algorithm aims to find the optimal move by assuming that both players play optimally.
This means that each player will always choose the move that best advances their own position.


### TODO

Clean front end

Multiplier mode

# Tictacto

Very simple ugly tictacto but with little twist :

a implementation of the minmax algorithm

and for the futur implementation of a multiplier mode


In here we try to find the optimal score.


The Minmax algorithm aims to find the optimal move by assuming that both players play optimally.
This means that each player will always choose the move that best advances their own position.
